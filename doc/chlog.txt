20121212:

  ref_data.c were improved to raise RANGE_ERROR, when they are
  called with NULL.

- The makefiles and the file setpaths.c were improved to accept the
  macros S7_LIB_DIR (Directory with static Seed7 object libraries)
  and SEED7_LIBRARY (Directory with the Seed7 include libraries).
  Now the build process of a package can call make e.g. with:
  make S7_LIB_DIR=/abc/seed7/bin SEED7_LIBRARY=/abc/seed7/lib depend
  This way the two paths are defined in version.h. This defines them
  as default paths in the interpreter executable and in the compiler.

  added to the FAQ. This can be used as guideline for Seed7 packages.
- The description of the times-operator in the manual and in
  array.s7i was improved.
- A description of the function name(PROGRAM), file(PROGRAM) and
  'environment' was added to the manual.
- The new library environment.s7i was added. Most of the contents of
  this library was extracted from "seed7_05.sd7". The new library is
  included from "seed7_05.s7i", so no change in existing programs is
  necessary.

- The compiler (comp.sd7) was improved to use definitions of
  NOT_A_NUMBER, POSITIVE_INFINITY and NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
- The program chkccomp.c was improved. Now it manages the macros
  likely, unlikely, UNISTD_H_PRESENT, POPEN_MISSING, os_utime_orig,
  os_utime, USE_ALTERNATE_UTIME, INCLUDE_SYS_UTIME, USE_LOCALTIME_R,
  USE_LOCALTIME_S, FLOAT_ZERO_DIV_ERROR, CHECK_FLOAT_DIV_BY_ZERO,
  ISNAN_WITH_UNDERLINE and HOME_DIR_ENV_VAR. Additionally chkccomp.c
  does not depend on the definitions of long_long_EXISTS,
  long_long_SUFFIX_LL, __int64_EXISTS, __int64_SUFFIX_LL and
  USE_BUILTIN_EXPECT in chkccomp.h.

  were improved to fit into a screen with a resolution of 1024 x 768.
- The library make.s7i was improved: The parsing of command
  parameters (used by the Unix version of the echo command), was
  improved. The processing of pattern rules was improved (The rule
  with the shortest stem value is used, when several rules match).

  stdfont16.s7i, stdfont18.s7i, stdfont20.s7i and stdfont24.s7i were
  improved to include bitmapfont.s7i.
- The program dnafight.sd7 was improved to limit the speed of the
  animation.
- The program make7.sd7 was improved to recognize the options
  correctly. Additionally make7 inherits also all improvements of
  makedata.s7i and make.s7i.
- The program ftp7.sd7 was improved to accept the option -?.

  compiled, is now explained in the FAQ and in 'src/read_me.txt'.
- A description of the for-step-statement was added to the manual.
- The library make.s7i was improved. Now makefile dependencies can
  contain colons (:) and equal signs (=). The parameters of the echo

  is used by programs other than make7.sd7.

20120603:
- An alternate version of the function 'filInputReady' was added to
  the file "fil_unx.c" (thanks to Rainer Weikusat and Geoff Clare
  for their help). The new function is used when "version.h" does
  not define the macro 'read_buffer_empty'.
- A check and a definition of the macro 'read_buffer_empty' for
  HPUX was added to "chkccomp.c" (thanks to Richard Kettlewell and
  Marc for their suggestions).

  calling 'setElem' respectively 'setExcl'.
- The compiler was improved to use 'setIsEmpty' (which is defined in
  "set_rtl.c"), when a set is compared with the empty set (action
  "SET_EQ" and "SET_NE").
- Interpreter, compiler and runtime library were improved to support
  the actions "PRG_INTERPRETER" (returns the path of the hi
  interpreter), "SET_NEXT" (used in for-loops over sets) and

  several functions.
- The example program "printpi2.sd7" was improved.

  "version.h" by the program "chkccomp.c").
- The makefiles were changed to write several macro definitions to
  "version.h", before the program "chkccomp.c" is compiled. This way
  "chkccomp.c" gets information about the C compiler from
  "version.h".
- The functions 'setDiff' and 'setSymdiff' in "set_rtl.c" were
  improved to work correctly for big sets.

  in "drw_x11.c" were improved to raise RANGE_ERROR when the
  window does not exist.

  handle the job of calling 'redraw'.

  inline functions).

  with constant types.
- The function timFromIntTimestamp was introduced in "tim_rtl.c" and used
  in "timlib.c" and in compiled code.

20110116:
- The chapter explaining 'operating system access' in the manual was improved.

  with the new standard path representation.
- The spacing between characters in the standard bitmap fonts was improved.
- The example programs startrek.sd7, wiz.sd7, mind.sd7, wumpus.sd7 and

  representation. E.g.: "C:\seed7" is converted to "/c/seed7". When a path
  is already in the standard path representation it is left unchanged.
- Functions with path parameters or path result were improved to accept
  and return file paths with the standard path representation. The standard
  path representation uses a slash as path separator. Under Windows a
  standard path like "/c" is mapped to the drive letter "C:". Reading the
  directory "/" under Windows returns a list of available drives.

  and MID statements as equivalent to MID$ statements.

  manage the compilation process, was added. Make7 is capable to compile
  the Seed7 release with every mk_*.mak makefile released with Seed7.
- Code was moved from the "tar7.sd7" example program to the new library
  "tar.s7i". The "tar.s7i" library allows programs to deal with tar files
  without the need to call external programs.
- The directory seed7/bin was introduced as place for executables and
  runtime libraries. This should allow installing Seed7 by adding the
  seed7/bin directory to the PATH. Additionally the environment variable
  SEED7_LIBRARY can be defined to contain the path of the seed7/lib directory.

  bigInteger values, was improved.

  'toMycroSeconds' and 'MYCRO_SECONDS' were renamed to 'micro_second',
  'getMicroSeconds', 'toMicroSeconds' and 'MICRO_SECONDS' respectively. This
  changes were done in the example programs and in the "time.s7i" library.
- The functions 'setATime' and 'setMTime' in 'time.s7i' were improved to raise
  RANGE_ERROR when the specified time is illegal or outside the allowed range.
- The carddemo.sd7 example program was improved to allow moving, raising and
  lowering cards with the mouse and mouse buttons.
- The function 'getHttp' in the "gethttp.s7i" library was improved to handle
  the status codes 301, 302, 303 and 307.

  hash has struct elements.
- The "tar7.sd7" example program was improved to check if a file already
  exists.
- The function 'bst_cpy' in "bstlib.c" was fixed to use 'take_bstri' instead
  of 'take_stri'.
- The function 'cmdFileType' in "cmd_rtl.c" was improved to return FILE_ABSENT
  when one element in the path is not a directory.
- The "drw_x11.c" driver was improved: Expose events now draw only the exposed
  area. The exposed area is not cleared before the expose event is delivered.
  Expose events for the whole window are avoided, when a window is resized.
- The function 'drwFlush' in "drw_x11.c" now proceeds until no expose events
  are present.
- The function 'find_window' in "drw_x11.c" now manages the windows with a
  hash table instead of a linked list.
- The new function 'processEvents' in "drw_x11.c" looks for expose events and
  processes them.
