THE HI INTERPRETER
==================

  The hi Interpreter is called with the command

    hi [options] sourcefile [parameters]

  Note that the options must be written before the sourcefile.
  If the sourcefile is not found .sd7 is appended to the sourcefile
  and searched for that file.

  The following options are recognized by hi:

    -a   Analyze only and suppress the execution phase.

    -dx  Set compiletime trace level to x. Where x is a string consisting
         of the following characters:

           a Trace primitive actions
           c Do action check
           d Trace dynamic calls
           e Trace exceptions and handlers
           h Trace heapsize (in combination with 'a')

    -d   Equivalent to -da

    -i   Show the identifier table after the analyzing phase.

    -m   Use less memory during the analyzing phase.
         If there is a "No more memory" error you can try this
         option.

    -q   Compile quiet. Line and file information and compilation
         statistics are suppressed.

    -tx  Set runtime trace level to x. Where x is a string consisting
         of the following characters:

           a Trace primitive actions
           c Do action check
           d Trace dynamic calls
           e Trace exceptions and handlers
           h Trace heapsize (in combination with 'a')

    -t   Equivalent to -ta

    -v   Compile verbose. Write line numbers while analyzing.

    -x   Execute even when the program contains errors.

  The parameters can be accessed via the argv(PROGRAM) procedure.
  argv(PROGRAM) delivers an array of strings. length(argv(PROGRAM))
  is the number of parameters while argv(PROGRAM)[1] is the first
  parameter.

  The environment can be accessed via the getenv(string) function.
  getenv(string) delivers a string containing the value of the environment
  variable described with 'string'. If no such variable exists the
  empty string is delivert.

  The interpreter is designed to analyze a program as fast as possible.
  This should speed up the typical programming cycle:

    while not OK do
      edit program
      test program
    end while;

  Note that a good design of your program is necessary before you
  start this cycle. But when you start programming you can act
  very fast. No compile time and no link time hurts you.
