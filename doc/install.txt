INSTALLATION
============

    The Seed7 package consists of a lot of files. There are two
  ways to install them. In a simple installation just use the seed7
  directorys 'src', 'prg' and 'doc' from the tar file. To compile
  the interpreter just go to the 'src' directory and type:

    gmake depend
    gmake

  When the interpreter is compiled just go to the 'prg' directory
  and start a program like hello.sd7 with:

    hi hello

  The programs find their include files in the local directory.
  No path (except . ) must be set. This installation can be used for
  playing a little bit with the example programs.

    In a professional installation Seed7 programs can be executed
  direct with their name from any directory and from any user.
  This means that the programs can be used for production
  programs.

    To do a professional installation the following things must
  be done:

    1. Put the interpreter (hi) in a directory with public
       access which is in the search path. In our example we
       chose /usr/local/bin. The advantage of being in the
       search path is that direct calls of hi (Like: hi myprog)
       can be done from any directory (Provided that myprog is
       there).

    2. Put the include files (Extension .s7i) in a directory
       with public access. In our example we chose
       /usr/seed7/include. The directory and the files must
       have read access for any user.

    To generate a Seed7 program which can be called from any
  directory and from any user the following things must be done:

    1. The first three lines in the program must be:

         #! /usr/local/bin/hi
         $ info off
         $ library "/usr/seed7/include"

       The first line informs the operating system where
       to find the interpreter to execute the program.
       The second line informs the interpreter to suppress the
       compiling information. (This is not necessary but we
       assume the program is tested and the compiling
       information is not wanted in a production program)
       The third line of the program informs the interpreter
       where to find the include files.

    2. Rename the file to the name you want and put it in a
       directory which is member of the path (For example:
       /usr/local/bin).

    3. Make the file executable with

         chmod 755 myprog

    4. Test it by calling from another directory
