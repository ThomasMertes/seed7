There are a lot of minor problems ...

  - Not all documentation files are completely up to date.
    The documentation files are correct but some minor changes
    in the programming language might not be documented or
    might be documented wrong.
    Normally this does not hurt. When you see differences in the
    actual behaviour look at the programming examples.

  - Rational literals are not implemented.
    All literals with a dot ( . ) are of type 'float'.
    It is possible to use the division ( / ) of two integers to
    generate a rational number. For example

      const rational: RAT_NUM is 2/3;

    This division and all other operations for RATIONAL numbers
    are defined in the file rational.s7i.
    The constant rational.value can be used instead of 0/1 .

  - The notation to write periodical decimal numbers is
    not implemented now.

  - It is not possible to initialize a local variable with the
    value of a parameter.
