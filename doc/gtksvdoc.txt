Leonardo Cecchi wrote a gtk-server connection component.
It contains:

1) The gtk-server component (lib/gtkserver.s7i). It uses a tcp
socket communication.
2) The robodoc generated documentation for the component
(doc/gtksvdoc.htm and doc/gtksvdoc.css).
3) A little test program. It's only a window with two buttons and some
callbacks (prg/gtksvtst.sd7).
4) The robodoc.rc file with the Seed7 configurations that he used to
generate the documentation. It may be useful for others.

If you try it, please start the gtk-server before running the
test program with:

gtk-server tcp=127.0.0.1:8765 &
