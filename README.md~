WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF SEED7

Seed7 is a general purpose programming language. It is a higher level language compared to Ada, C++ and Java. In Seed7 new statements and operators can be defined easily. Functions with type results and type parameters are more elegant than the usual template or generics concept. Object orientation is used when it brings advantages and not in places when other solutions are more obvious. Although Seed7 contains several concepts of other programming languages it cannot be seen as direct descendant of another programming language. To get a general overview over the language read: doc/manual.txt (Chapter: Introduction). The [Seed7 manual is also online](http://seed7.sourceforge.net/manual/index.htm).

WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THIS PACKAGE?

The Seed7 package contains the Seed7 interpreter in source besides documentation files, include files and program examples. The following sub directories exist:

* src     The source of the interpreter
* prg    Program examples
* lib      Include files
* doc    Documentation files
* bin     Executables and runtime libraries

  Using the extension several files can be distinguished:

* \*.txt      Documentation files
* \*.sd7    Program example files
* \*.s7i     Include files
* \*.dna   Include file for the dna program
* \*.c        C source file
* \*.h       C include file

HOW TO COMPILE THE INTERPRETER?

For Linux this is quite simple (to compile under other operating systems see 'seed7/src/read\_me.txt'). The 'makefile' is prepared for Linux. First make sure that gcc, make and the development packages for X11 and ncurses are installed. Then go to the 'src' directory and type:

make depend

make

After the compilation the interpreter is linked to the file 'seed7/prg/s7'. The Seed7 compiler (s7c) is compiled with:

make s7c

The file 'seed7/src/read\_me.txt' contains a detailed explanation of the compilation process.



HOW TO COMPILE UNDER OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS?

Seed7 supports several operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS X and various Unix variants. How to compile under these operating systems is explained in the file 'seed7/src/read\_me.txt'.



HOW TO EXECUTE A PROGRAM?

After compiling the interpreter you can make the first test. Switch to the 'prg' directory and type:

./s7 hello

This executes the hello world program which is in the 'hello.sd7' file. Every file with the '.sd7' extension can be executed with the 's7' interpreter.

A list of the program files with a short description can be found in the file: prg/files.



WHAT TO DO WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE COMPILATION?

There is a read\_me.txt file in the seed7/src directory which discusses the compilation process with more detail.



HOW TO SEND A PATCH?

If you want to participate, you are always welcome. I would be glad to receive patches in the unified diff format:

diff -urN oldseed7dir/ newseed7dir/ > patch.diff

If you send a patch, it is assumed that this patch is released under the GPL (or LGPL for libraries) license.
