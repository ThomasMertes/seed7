(**
 *  Executes a program using the shell of the operating system.
 *  The comand string must contain the program name and an optional
 *  space separated list of parameters. The 'shell' function always
 *  uses slashes as path separator for the command path (independend
 *  of the operating system used). Spaces in the program name (or
 *  path) must be preceded by a backslash (E.g.: shell("do\\ it"); ).
 *  The first space without preceding backslash marks the end of the
 *  program name. Command parameters containing a space must be
 *  enclosed in double quotes (E.g.: shell("do_it \"par 1\" par2"); ).
 *  The commands supported and the path delimiters used in parameters
 *  of a specific command are not coverd by the description of the
 *  'shell' function. Due to the usage of the operating system shell
 *  and of external programs it is hard to write portable programs
 *  which use the 'shell' function.
 *  @return the return code of the executed command or of the shell.
