(**
 *  Abstract data type, describing sets of ''baseType'' values.
 *  This abstract data type decides about the implementation of the
 *  set. When ''baseType'' values can be mapped to [[integer]] with
 *  the ''ord'' function and ''ord'' does never raise an exception
 *  the set is implemented as [[bitsetof|bitset]], otherwise the set
 *  is implemented as [[hashsetof|hashset]].
 *  Sets of [[integer]] numbers are described with [[bitset]].
